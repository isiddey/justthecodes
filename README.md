### Just the Codes
Collection of _random codes_ and _algorithms_ from various sources.

### How to explore
Snippets are random codes which solve the simplest tasks. They have been organized according to the level of the complexity of task completed. 
Algorithms solve complex problems. They have futher been organized according to the type of problem they solve.

### How to use
Just copy the code and feel free to use it anywhere.

#### Sources
